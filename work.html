						<span class="jobTitle">Freelance Web Development and Design</span>
						<p class="jobSummary">Worked closely with their founders to design and develop a look/feel and user experience for the brand's site, as well as a custom CMS back end on Google App Engine for Python so they can customize and grow the eCommerce part of their site. Developed a “social media community” aspect of the site where users can sign up with Facebook, Twitter, or their own Positive Energy account and share thoughts, photos, and YouTube/Vimeo videos. The community also scrapes posts from Twitter and Facebook to aggregate all of Positive Energy’s social media interactions in one place.</span>

						<p class="jobSummary">I built a bookmarklet that, when clicked, scrapes the current Open Table page you are on and then prompts you to set up a Rezhound reservation alert without you having to input any information or leave Open Table. This was a great Javascript crash course as well as requiring hacking together a light communication system between the Rezhound iframe popup and its parent Open Table page so that they could pass messages back and forth in a normally isolated environment.</span>
